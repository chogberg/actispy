# Actispy - spy on your activities

Actispy is a activity tracking software to track activities such as:

* Running
* Cycling
* Hiking

It's a webapp designed for Firefox OS: It's main principles are:

* Your Data is your data: nothing leaves your device unless you want it to
* The data is stored in easy to re-use formats 
* Simple UI beats all 

## Install

Until Actispy has made it to the Firefox Marketplace you can install it
through the Appmanager: Clone this repository and add a packaged app.

## Contribute

There are many ways you can contribute to make Actispy the best app for
Activity Tracking on Firefox OS:

* Use it and give feedback through the Github issues
* Create a good and appealing design (I am by no way a designer)
* Help code the functionality! (Actispy is built on Angular and Leaflet).
